# Proxy Server

# Test Task from Ivelum company 
Original task here https://github.com/ivelum/job/blob/master/challenges/python.md
___
My time to solve this task is 15h with timeouts to read some particles from BS4 documentation


## Установка и запуск

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Urodec777/proxy_server.git
```
Next step is creating venv
```bash
  python3 -m venv *your venv name*
```

Install all requirements from `requirements.txt` file

Then `python manage.py migrate` to create db, `python manage.py runserver` to start server.

Enjoy :blush:
